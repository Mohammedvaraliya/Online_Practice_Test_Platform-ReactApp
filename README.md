## **Data Structure: Sample Question Format**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "question": "-67 x (-1) = ?",
    "options": ["-1", "-67", "67", "1"],
    "correct_answer": "67",
    "difficulty": "easy",

## **Adaptive Testing Logic (CAT)**

The system dynamically selects questions based on performance using the following logic:

- ‚úÖ **Correct Answer** ‚Üí Increase difficulty
- ‚ùå **Incorrect Answer** ‚Üí Decrease difficulty

### üìà Difficulty Flow:

| Current | If Correct | If Incorrect |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| Easy    | Medium     | Easy         |
| Medium  | Hard       | Easy         |
| Hard    | Hard       | Medium       |
